# **Global Population Growth Prediction & EDA**

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict global population growth for various cities around the world. It involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, feature engineering, model development, and deployment. The final model is deployed as a web service using Flask, allowing users to make predictions via a REST API.

## Installation

Prerequisites

```bash
  Python 3.8 or later
  pip (Python package manager)
```
    
## Step-by-Step Installation

1. Clone the Repository:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Global_Population_Growth_Prediction_&_EDA.git
  cd Global_Population_Growth_Prediction_&_EDA
```

2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended):
```bash
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

```

3. Install the Required Libraries:
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Running the Pipeline

The project pipeline is automated in the main.py script. This script cleans the data, engineers features, trains the model with hyperparameter tuning, and evaluates its performance.

To Run the Pipeline:
```bash
  python main.py
```

This will: 
> - Load the raw data from ```data/raw_data.csv```.
> - Clean the data and save the processed data to ```data/processed_data.csv```.
> - Engineer features and train a Random Forest model with hyperparameter tuning.
> - Save the trained model to ```models/population_growth_model.pkl```.
> - Evaluate the model and print the results.

## Model Deployment with Flask

The trained model is deployed as a REST API using Flask. The API allows users to send data and receive predictions in real-time.

### To Start the Flask Server:

```bash
python app.py
```
his will start a local web server at ```http://127.0.0.1:5000/```.

### Making Predictions
To make predictions, send a POST request to ```http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict``` with input data in JSON format. Example:
```
[
    {
        "Population (2023)": 1000000,
        "Growth Rate": 0.02,
        "Population Change": 20000,
        "Continent_Africa": 0,
        "Continent_Asia": 1,
        "Continent_Europe": 0,
        "Continent_North America": 0,
        "Continent_Oceania": 0,
        "Continent_South America": 0
    }
]
```



## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The ```01_eda.ipynb``` notebook contains the exploratory data analysis. It includes:

> - Visualization of population trends.
> - Distribution of growth rates.
> - Correlation analysis between features.

You can view a summarized EDA report in the ```reports/eda_report.html``` file.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Data cleaning steps are documented in the ```02_data_cleaning.ipynb``` notebook and automated in the ```data_cleaning.py``` script. These steps include:

> - Handling missing values.
> - Detecting and handling outliers.
> - Creating new features for the model.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is done in the ```03_feature_engineering.ipynb``` notebook and implemented in the ```feature_engineering.py``` script. This includes:

> - Encoding categorical variables.
> - Scaling numerical features.
> - Selecting the best features for the model.


## Model Development and Evaluation

Model development and evaluation are covered in the ```modeling.ipynb``` and ```evaluation.ipynb``` notebooks. The best model is trained and saved using the ```train_model.py``` script. Evaluation results are generated using the ```evaluate_model.py``` script.
## Requirements

All required libraries are listed in ```requirements.txt```. Install them using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
## Future Work

> - **Model Improvement:*** Explore more advanced machine learning models like Gradient Boosting or Neural Networks.
> - **Deployment:** Consider deploying the Flask app on a cloud service like Heroku or AWS.
> - **Real-Time Data:** Integrate real-time data feeds to continuously update predictions.
