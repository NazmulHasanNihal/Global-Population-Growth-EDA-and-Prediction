# pandas: Essential for data manipulation and analysis.

# numpy: Provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

# matplotlib: Used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

# seaborn: Built on top of Matplotlib, it provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.

# scikit-learn: A robust machine learning library in Python. It includes implementations of various machine learning algorithms, preprocessing tools, and evaluation metrics.

# joblib: Helps in serializing and de-serializing Python objects like trained machine learning models.

# flask: A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python. It's used here to create a web service for your model deployment.

# pandas-profiling and sweetviz (Optional): Tools for generating interactive EDA reports automatically.

# jupyterlab (Optional): JupyterLab is the next-generation user interface for Project Jupyter, offering all the familiar building blocks of the classic Jupyter Notebook in a flexible and powerful user interface.
